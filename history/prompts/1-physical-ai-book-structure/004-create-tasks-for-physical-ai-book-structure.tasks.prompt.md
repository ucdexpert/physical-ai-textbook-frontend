## Prompt

/sp.tasks

## Response snapshot

I have created the tasks for the "Book Structure and Layout for Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics (4 Modules)" feature.

The tasks are located at `specs/1-physical-ai-book-structure/tasks.md`.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: A detailed set of tasks has been created, which will guide the implementation of the book structure.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run.
- 📁 Files: 
  - `specs/1-physical-ai-book-structure/tasks.md` (created)
- 🔁 Next prompts: The user can now proceed with implementing the tasks.
- 🧠 Reflection: The process of creating the tasks was successful. The plan was detailed enough to create a comprehensive set of tasks.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None.
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): PASS
- Prompt variant (if applicable): None
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): None
