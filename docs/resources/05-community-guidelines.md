# Community and Contribution Guidelines

## Overview
This course thrives on community engagement and contributions. This section outlines how you can get involved, provide feedback, report issues, and contribute to the ongoing development and improvement of the "Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics" book. Your active participation helps foster a vibrant learning environment for everyone.

## How to Contribute:

### 1. Suggesting Improvements and Providing Feedback
- **Clarity and Accuracy**: If you find sections that are unclear, confusing, or contain technical inaccuracies, please let us know.
- **New Topics**: Suggest topics or areas you believe would enhance the course content or fill a gap.
- **Learning Experience**: Provide feedback on the overall learning experience, including pace, examples, and exercises.
- **Method**: Use the project's GitHub Issues. Label your suggestions appropriately (e.g., `enhancement`, `feedback`).

### 2. Reporting Issues
- **Bugs and Errors**: If you encounter any bugs in code examples, typos in the text, or broken links, please report them.
- **Reproducible Steps**: When reporting a bug, always include clear steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and actual behavior.
- **Environment Details**: Provide details about your environment (OS, ROS 2 version, Isaac Sim version, Python version, hardware).
- **Method**: Use the project's GitHub Issues. Label your report as `bug`.

### 3. Contributing Code and Content
- **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the main course repository on GitHub.
- **Create a Feature Branch**: Create a new branch for your contributions (e.g., `feat/add-new-chapter`, `fix/ros2-bug`).
- **Implement Changes**: Make your changes, adhering to the project's coding style and content guidelines.
- **Test Your Changes**: Ensure any code changes are tested and work as expected.
- **Submit a Pull Request (PR)**:
    - Clearly describe the purpose of your PR.
    - Reference any related issues.
    - Ensure your branch is up-to-date with the main repository.
    - Address any review comments promptly.
- **Content Guidelines**:
    - Follow the established markdown format for chapters.
    - Maintain a clear, concise, and technical writing style.
    - Ensure all code examples are runnable and include usage/verification instructions.
    - Provide complete, runnable code for all examples (full imports, `main()`, etc.).
    - Specify versions for ROS 2, Isaac Sim, Python.
    - Reference relevant modules (e.g., "This is Module 1, Week 3 content...").
    - Clarify hardware context (workstation vs. Jetson).
    - Focus on real robotics (physics, sensors, actuators).

### 4. Code of Conduct
- We are committed to fostering an open and welcoming environment. Please review and adhere to our Code of Conduct to ensure respectful and inclusive interactions.

### 5. Assessment Rubrics
- For learners completing this course as part of a structured program, please refer to the Assessment Rubrics for details on how your contributions and project work will be evaluated.
