# Introduction to Physical AI

**Week 1 | Module 0 | Estimated Time: 2 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Define Physical AI and contrast it with purely digital AI.
- Explain the concept of embodied intelligence and its importance.
- Identify the key components of a Physical AI system's sensor-motor loop.
- Describe the challenges and opportunities in transitioning AI from digital to physical domains.

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of what Artificial Intelligence (AI) is.
- No programming or robotics experience required.

## Overview
This chapter introduces the exciting field of Physical AI—intelligent systems that can perceive, reason about, and interact with the physical world. Unlike purely digital AI that exists only in software (like language models or game-playing bots), Physical AI gives intelligence a body, enabling it to perform meaningful tasks in our human environment. We will explore the fundamental concept of embodied intelligence, which posits that an agent's physical form is integral to its cognitive processing.

We will deconstruct the core feedback loop that drives all Physical AI systems: the perception-action cycle. This involves understanding how an agent uses sensors to gather data about its environment, processes that data to make decisions, and then actuates its motors to effect change in the world. This chapter sets the stage for the entire course, highlighting why bridging the gap between the digital and physical realms is the next great frontier in AI and robotics. We'll touch on real-world applications, from autonomous humanoids in logistics to assistive robots in healthcare.

## Key Concepts
- **Embodied Intelligence**: The theory that intelligence emerges from the interaction between an agent's physical body, its brain (control system), and its environment.
- **Physical World Understanding**: An AI's ability to comprehend concepts like gravity, friction, object permanence, and cause-and-effect in a physical context.
- **Sensor-Motor Loop**: The continuous cycle of sensing the environment, thinking or processing the sensory input, and acting upon the environment.
- **Human-Robot Interaction (HRI)**: The study of how humans and robots can communicate and work together effectively and safely.
- **Digital Twin**: A virtual model of a physical object or system that serves as its digital counterpart, used for simulation, testing, and analysis.

## What You'll Build
This is a conceptual chapter, so there is no hands-on build. You will build a foundational mental model for understanding the projects in later chapters.

## Tools & Technologies
- None for this chapter.

## Next Steps
- Proceed to the next chapter, "Why Physical AI Matters," to understand the specific advantages of humanoid robots in human-centric environments.
