# Humanoid Robotics Landscape

**Week 2 | Module 0 | Estimated Time: 2 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Survey the current landscape of leading humanoid robot platforms.
- Compare and contrast at least three major humanoid robots based on their actuators, sensors, and intended applications.
- Understand the key development trends shaping the future of humanoid robotics.
- Differentiate between research platforms and commercially-focused robots.

## Prerequisites
- General understanding of robotics concepts from previous chapters.

## Overview
This chapter provides a tour of the current state-of-the-art in humanoid robotics. We will move from theory to practice, examining the hardware, capabilities, and goals of the companies and research labs at the forefront of the field. We will cover iconic platforms like Boston Dynamics' Atlas, known for its dynamic locomotion, and explore the design philosophies of commercially-focused robots like Tesla's Optimus and Unitree's G1, which prioritize cost-effectiveness and manufacturability.

You will learn to analyze and compare these platforms based on critical engineering tradeoffs, such as the choice between hydraulic and electric actuators, the complexity of their sensor suites, and their software control architectures. We will also look at leading academic research platforms that push the boundaries of what is possible. By the end of this chapter, you will have a clear map of the industry, understand the major players, and recognize the key trends driving the rapid evolution of humanoid robots from lab curiosities to viable commercial products.

## Key Concepts
- **Bipedal vs. Wheeled Platforms**: The fundamental tradeoff between the mobility and versatility of legs versus the speed and efficiency of wheels.
- **Actuator Types**: The primary movers in a robot, typically hydraulic (powerful but complex) or electric (cleaner and more precise).
- **Control Architectures**: The software strategy for controlling the robot, ranging from model-based control to end-to-end deep learning policies.
- **Cost-Performance Tradeoffs**: The engineering decisions made to balance a robot's capabilities with its final cost and reliability.
- **Commercial vs. Research Platforms**: The difference in design goals between robots intended for sale and those built to explore new scientific questions.

## What You'll Build
- You will create a comparison matrix (e.g., in a spreadsheet or markdown table) that evaluates three different humanoid robots across five key features (e.g., actuator type, key sensors, cost, primary application, key advantage).

## Tools & Technologies
- Web browser for research.
- Markdown editor or spreadsheet software.

## Next Steps
- Advance to "Sensor Systems Overview" to take a deeper dive into the specific components that allow these robots to perceive and understand the world.
