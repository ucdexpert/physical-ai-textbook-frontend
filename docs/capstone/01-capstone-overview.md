# Capstone Project Overview

**Estimated Time: 2 hours**

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the full scope and objectives of the Capstone Project.
- Identify the key components and modules to be integrated.
- Plan the overall architecture and data flow for the autonomous humanoid.
- Define a project timeline and deliverables for the Capstone.

## Prerequisites
- Completed all previous Modules (ROS 2, Digital Twin, NVIDIA Isaac, VLA).
- Strong understanding of all core concepts covered in the course.

## Overview
This Capstone Project is the culmination of your entire journey through Physical AI and Humanoid Robotics. It challenges you to integrate everything you've learned—from ROS 2 fundamentals and high-fidelity simulation to advanced AI perception, planning, and multi-modal interaction—into a cohesive, autonomous humanoid robot system. The goal is to build a simulated (and potentially real, if hardware is available) humanoid that can respond to voice commands to perform a complex task, such as navigating to an object, identifying it, picking it up, and placing it elsewhere.

This chapter provides a comprehensive overview of the Capstone Project's scope, objectives, and high-level requirements. We will break down the project into its core components: voice command integration, cognitive planning, navigation, obstacle avoidance, object identification, and manipulation. You will be guided through defining a project plan, outlining key integration points, and establishing a realistic timeline for bringing your autonomous humanoid to life. This project is your opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge to a practical, real-world challenge.

## Key Concepts
- **System Integration**: The process of combining different subsystems (e.g., perception, navigation, manipulation, voice control) into a single, functional robotic system.
- **Autonomous Humanoid**: A humanoid robot capable of understanding high-level commands and executing complex tasks without continuous human intervention.
- **Voice Command Interface**: The front-end of the system, allowing users to issue instructions to the robot using natural language.
- **Cognitive Planning**: The high-level reasoning component that translates user commands into executable sequences of robot actions.
- **Navigation Stack**: The software modules responsible for autonomous movement, including localization, mapping, path planning, and obstacle avoidance.
- **Object Identification**: The perception module that uses computer vision to detect and classify objects in the environment.
- **Object Manipulation**: The control module responsible for grasping, lifting, and placing objects using the robot's arm and hand.

## What You'll Build
- A detailed project plan document for your Capstone Project, including:
    - High-level system architecture diagram.
    - Component breakdown with responsibilities.
    - Tentative timeline with milestones.
    - Defined success metrics for the overall project.

## Tools & Technologies
- All tools and technologies covered in previous modules (ROS 2, Isaac Sim, `rclpy`, Python, etc.).
- Collaborative documentation tools (e.g., Markdown, Mermaid diagrams).

## Next Steps
- Proceed to "Project Architecture and Design" to begin detailing the software architecture for your autonomous humanoid.
